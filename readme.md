# Volume Control

Hacky demo of volume being controlled by the angle of my screen. Closed = 0% volume Fully Open = 100% Volume.

It's written in Java because I know how to write in Java, and wanted to test out JNA.

Here it is working on my M2 MacBook Pro. Probably won't work on much else without some tweaking.

See [LidAngleSensor](https://github.com/samhenrigold/LidAngleSensor) for more info on how to get sensor readings.
